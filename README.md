# TMBST Discord Hack Week 2019 Submission - "Town of Discord"

## Description
This is our own spin off on the already known popular game: "Town of Salem".  
We limited the scope to just the mafia and citizens in order to have a nice working core.  
In the futuere, we hope to add more roles such as Doctor and Serial Killer to make the game more interesting.

## Further explaination of "Town of Salem" and Game Mechanics.
The goal of the ordinary citizen is to kill off the mafia by all means possible. You can start pointing figures you can get suspicious of people not talking, there is plenty of ways to find out who is who. The goal of the mafia is of course to kill off all the ordinary citizens. Each night, everyone (but the Mafia) goes to sleep. The mafia during the night is able to choose a user they wish to kill. When day arises, that user is now dead and it is up to the citizens to quickly figure out who the mafia is before more of the innocent dies.  

There are extra roles such as Doctor who can protect a citizen from an attack overnight. Serial Killer, who is its own entity and is not friendly towards citizens and mafia. The Serial Killer's goal is to kill everyone. These roles will be added in future implementations once we have confirmed a working core game.

## Commands (work in progress)
